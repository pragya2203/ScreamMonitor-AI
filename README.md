# ðŸ”Š Human Scream Detection using ML & Deep Learning

**Real-Time Crime Prevention with AI-Powered Audio Monitoring**

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

**ScreamMonitorAI** is an AI-based scream detection system designed to enhance public safety through real-time auditory threat recognition. Unlike traditional surveillance systems that rely solely on visuals, this solution listens for distress signalsâ€”specifically human screamsâ€”and triggers alerts to improve emergency response.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

* **Programming:** Python
* **ML/DL Frameworks:** TensorFlow, scikit-learn
* **Audio Processing:** Librosa (MFCC feature extraction)
* **GUI:** Kivy (for desktop application interface)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Highlights

* âœ… **AI-Driven Scream Detection System:**
  Developed using Python, TensorFlow, and Kivy to detect human screams in real-time.

* ðŸŽ§ **Robust Training Dataset:**
  Trained on 5,000+ labeled audio samples with MFCC feature extraction. Achieved **88.2% test accuracy** and **92.4% F1 score** through data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning.

* ðŸ”€ **Dual-Model Classification:**
  Combined predictions from **SVM** and **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** to reduce false positives and improve detection reliability.

* ðŸš¨ **Dual-Risk Alert Mechanism:**

  * **High Risk:** Both models detect a scream
  * **Medium Risk:** Only one model detects a scream
    Enables prioritized alerts and response.

* ðŸ“Š **Impact:**
  Demonstrated a **21% improvement in simulated public safety response times**. Future versions will include **automated emergency notifications**.
